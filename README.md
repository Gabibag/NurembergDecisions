# Nuremberg Decisions
\
History project for school.

This project is meant to simulate the nuremberg trials with the user being the judge. The way this works is the user then choose a punishment for a crime of a random person in the Nuremberg Trials. The program will then tell the user what the punishment actually was, while saving their choice in a file. This can be later refrenced and compared.

Note: Ui needs *LOT* of work


### Installation

1. Head over to the [releases tab](https://github.com/Gabibag/NurembergDecisions/releases/tag/new) and download the file that says .jar
2. Once download, double click to run it.

**Note:** Make sure Java 19 is installed on your device. This should already be done on Macos.

### Looking at Verdicts
1. Open your command line (terminal if mac, command prompt if windows)
2. CD to the directory that the jar is in. 
    - Don't know what that means? In your command line, type in `cd` (with a space after it)  and drag and drop the **folder** in which NurembergChoices.jar is. Then hit enter.
3. Run `jar xf NurembergChoices.jar`
4. Find the `verdicts.txt` file and open it, the others (except for the NurembergChoices.jar file) can be deleted.
