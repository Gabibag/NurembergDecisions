# Nuremberg Decisions
\
History project for school.

This project is meant to simulate the nuremberg trials with the user being the judge. The way this works is the user then choose a punishment for a crime of a random person in the Nuremberg Trials. The program will then tell the user what the punishment actually was, while saving their choice in a file. This can be later refrenced and compared.

Note: Ui needs *LOT* of work


## Installation

1. Head over to the [releases tab](https://github.com/Gabibag/NurembergDecisions/releases) and download the file that says NurembergDecisions.jar.
2. Move it into a folder. Name the folder whatever you want, it doesn't matter. This is to keep the verdics.txt file and the .jar file together. This step isn't exacly *necessary*, but very usefull for later.
3. Once download, double click to run it. 

**Note:** Make sure Java 19 is installed on your device. This should already be done on Macos.
