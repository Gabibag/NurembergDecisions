# Nuremberg Decisions
\
History project for school. \ 

The project shows the crimes people have committed during the Holocaust and how they were punished.
It does this by showing information about some people who were tried in the trials, and the crimes they committed. 
The user then choose a punishment for the crime, and the program will tell the user what the punishment actually was.
Currently, a framework is made, with everything but information about the crimes and punishments implemented. (Also the ui is kinda bad but shhh.)
