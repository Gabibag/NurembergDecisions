# Nuremberg Decisions
\
History project for school.

The project shows the crimes people have committed during the Holocaust and how they were punished.
It does this by showing information about some people who were tried in the trials, and the crimes they committed. 
The user then choose a punishment for the crime, and the program will tell the user what the punishment actually was, while saving their choice in a file.(Also the ui is kinda bad but shhh.)


### Installation

1. Head over to the [releases tab](https://github.com/Gabibag/NurembergDecisions/releases/tag/new) and download the file that says .jar
2. Once download, double click to run it.

**Note:** Make sure Java 19 is installed on your device. This should already be done on Macos.

### Looking at Verdicts

2. CD to the directory that the jar is in.
3. Run `jar xf jar-file NurembergChoices.jar`
4. Find the `verdicts.txt` file and open it, the others (except for the NurembergChoices.jar file) can be deleted.
